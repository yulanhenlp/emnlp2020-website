  title: Call for System Demonstrations | EMNLP 2020

* **You may also be interested in the main [call for papers](/call-for-papers).**

The EMNLP 2020 System Demonstration Program Committee invites proposals for the Demonstrations Program. Demonstrations may range from early research prototypes to mature production-ready systems. Of particular interest are publicly available open-source or open-access systems. We additionally strongly encourage demonstrations of industrial systems that are technologically innovative given the current state of the art of theory and applied research in computational linguistics. Each submitted demonstration must be accompanied by a submitted paper describing the system (see below).

Areas of interest include all topics related to theoretical and applied computational linguistics, such as (but not limited to) the topics listed on the main conference website. Submitted systems may be of the following types:
* Natural Language Processing systems or system components
* Application systems using language technology components
* Software tools for computational linguistics research
* Software for demonstration or evaluation
* Software supporting learning or education
* Tools for data visualization and annotation
* Development tools

Papers describing accepted demonstrations will be published in a companion volume of the EMNLP 2020 conference proceedings.

Please note: Commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Demonstrations Program and should be arranged as part of the Exhibit Program.


## Best Demo Award

As in previous years, EMNLP 2020’s demo track will feature a Best Demo Award. We hope to encourage researchers to make their code publicly available and in the form of an easy-to-use, runnable system.


## Important Dates

* Paper submission deadline: Monday July 13, 2020
* Notification of acceptance: Monday September 14, 2020
* Camera-ready submission: Monday, October 5, 2020

All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h ("anywhere on Earth").


## Submission of papers describing demonstrations

A paper submitted to accompany a demonstration should outline the design of the system and provide sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity, quality, and relevance to computational linguistics. A paper can do this by addressing the following questions:


* What problem does the proposed system address?
* Why is the system important and what is its impact?
* What is the novel in the approach/technology on which this system is based?
* Who is the target audience?
* How does the system work?
* How does it compare with existing systems?
* How is the system licensed?

Paper submission is electronic, using the [Softconf START conference management system](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/demos).

Style files should meet the requirements of the EMNLP main conference. Submissions may consist of up to 6 pages, plus unlimited references. Submissions must conform to the [EMNLP 2020 official style guidelines](/call-for-papers) and they must be in PDF format. The submissions have to be original work (unpublished), as the publication in EMNLP will be archival.

## Multiple Submission Policy

We follow the [Multiple Submission Policy](/call-for-papers#multiple-submission-policy) of the CFP of the EMNLP 2020 main conference.  The paper has to be written specifically for this conference and cannot be submitted elsewhere. The paper must also report on a substantial improvement (>30%), if the system that is being reported has been reported elsewhere already.

## Reviewing Policy

Reviewing will be single-blind, so authors do not need to conceal their identity. The paper should include the authors’ names and affiliations. Self-references are also allowed.

## Demo Details

As the conference will go purely virtual, all the demos will have to be presented online. All demos should be presented via a video conference tool in the allocated time slots during the demo session.  In addition, we strongly recommend all demos are provided via one of the following formats:  (1) A live demo website; or (2) A website with a downloadable installation package of the demo; unless this is impossible because some special hardware is required or access is otherwise limited.  The exact details of the demo session are still to be worked out and will be announced in due time.


 You are encouraged to submit a short (~2 minute) screencast video demonstrating the system together with your paper submission. This screencast will be used to evaluate the paper, but won’t be published unless requested. We encourage the authors to include visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams) in the paper. Authors will also be able to upload and submit additional material, if needed. If you choose to submit a screencast, please upload the video to some hosting site (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) and include the link in your paper submission. To ensure accessibility for deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers, we encourage authors to caption videos prior to submission.

* David Schlangen (University of Potsdam, Germany)
